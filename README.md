#Englands second alarm to vvar, against the Beast. Saul, with his Edomite has shed blood to his power; he smites Israels city, and destroyes his owne house; overcame his people once, and overthrew himselfe for ever! It relates to what is done now. Grave questions touching the Edomite; his admission to court, and into office there; how it relates to papists now. He has a commission to destroy a city of priests, which he does with an utter destruction. Excellent reasons why the Lord suffered such a destruction to be executed upon Israel then; and why he suffers the same now; and why by an Edomites hand then and now.#

ENGLANDS SECOND Alarm to VVar, Againſt the Beaſt. Saul, with his Edomite has ſhed blood to his power
#####Body#####

1. ENGLANDS ALARM TO VVar, againſt the Beaſt.

    _ SECT. II. THe Edomite is Sauls Scout now, and his Generall in the Field anon: Davids enemy alwaies, The Prieſts accuſer; but can charge him with no more but what was his office to do, therefore not ſo impudent as are the Edomites in our dayes: Saul impleads the Prieſt; gives him leave to make anſwer for himſelfe, which he doth clearly and fully; and then is deſtroyed, he, and a City of Prieſts, man, woman, and childe there, and beaſt alſo. This relates fully to our times. Quaeries touching the Edomite. Sauls taking him into his Court, aſsigning him to office there, and giving him commiſsion to ſmite a City of Prieſts. Quaeries touching that miſerable deſtruction. Gods judgements ſecret, but juſt and righteous upon Ireland, and England. Yet the miſchiefe done by man ſhall returne upon his owne head, and his violent dealing upon his owne pate.

      * CHAP. I. David comes to Nob; Doeg ſpies him there; haſtens to Saul, tels him all his obſervations, yet can lay nothing to the Prieſts charge, but what was the Prieſts duty to doe. Doeg tels truth, yet loved lying. The Edomites now, more ſhameleſſe.

      * CHAP. II. Saul impleads Abimelech; he makes anſwer for himſelfe, which clears the caſe of all the righteous now, and the great caſe now in queſtion. Saul is not ſatisfied with reaſon, but, notwithstanding reaſon and Law both, command alſo from Gods mouth for what Abimelech did, Saul ſlayeth Abimelech, and deſtroy's the City of Prieſts.

      * CHAP. 3. The Prieſts Arraignment, impleadings, and Anſwers run-up paerallell with ours in theſe times, ſo does the upſhot or determination of the buſineſſe; for there was Peace in propoſition, but none in concluſion betwixt Saul and David. So here. Saul has ſhed blood, which runs-up to theſe times too, but with a fuller ſtream of bloods: yet the voice of Blood cryes louder, then does the voice of Bloods.

      * CHAP. 4. Quaeries touching the Edomite, whether by the knowne Lawes of Iſraels Kingdome, Saul might entertaine him in his Court; grant him a Commiſſion to ſmite a City of Prieſts; whether any reaſon for that; whether ſingle or plurall; and whether by any poſſible meanes an Edomite may be made ſerviceable to Iſrael; How it relates to the preſent, exemplifying the Hiſtory of our Time.

      * CHAP. 5. Sad Caſes examined and tryed before the Lord, and reſolved from His Mouth; which may ſilence a Poore People, ſlaine all the day long by the hurtfull and oppreſsing Sword, now in the hand of bloody Edomites.

      * CHAP. 6. Weighty Reaſons, Why The LORD ſuffers the Edomites to lay waſt Iſraels Land; how it Relates to this time. If Wolves had not beene grievous to our Land, they had not been deſtroyed out of the Land.
